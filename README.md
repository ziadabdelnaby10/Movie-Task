# Movie Task App
This project is a practical assessment which is rendering some contents in a json file attached in the assets folder in an android app

## Description:
1. Show the movieâ€™s different categories and on clicking on category details will show the available movies.
2. For each movie show its name, description.
3. User can add a new category.
4. User can add, edit, delete movies.

## The things that are done:
1. Parsed the contents of the json file with Gson Library
2. Create the database:
  2.1 create the Category Table
  2.2 create the Movie Table
  2.3 create the CategoryWithMovie Table which is a 1 - N Relation in Sqlite
  2.4 create the Data Access Object 
  2.5 create the singleton Database class
  2.6 create the MovieRepository to use the Room Operations
3. create the ViewModel For each Activity (Category - Movie)
4. used Coroutine to handle the threading in the viewmodel
5. add the parsed data from the json file into the database only one time using sharedprefrences then the user can add or delete what ever he wants (note : could've used RoomDatabase.callback)
6. construct the recyclerview for the two activities 
7. used kotlin higher level order funtion instead of interfaces to handle the click listeners in recyclerview
